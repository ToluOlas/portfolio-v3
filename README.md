# This version of my portfolio was created with the assistance of generative AI, primarily to modernise the previous version of the website. The older version of this website is also available on my Github in a separate repository.

Even with prompt engineering, these tools still require a highly knowledgeable engineer to add their own knowledge and add the missing parts that only a person can see.
